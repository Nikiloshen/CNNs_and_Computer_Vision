# Tennis Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to build an AI/ML tennis analysis system using YOLO, PyTorch, and key point extraction techniques. The system tracks players, tennis balls, and court positions, providing comprehensive performance metrics to enhance training and game strategies.

## Highlights
- 🎾 **Detect and Track**: Real-time detection and tracking of players and tennis balls.
- 📏 **Performance Metrics**: Measure player speed and distance covered during matches.
- ⚡ **YOLO Training**: Fine-tune the YOLO model for improved ball detection accuracy.
- 🖼️ **Key Point Extraction**: Utilize PyTorch for extracting critical court key points.
- 🔄 **Object Tracking**: Implement continuous analysis through robust object tracking.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Visualize performance metrics with a mini court representation.

## Key Insights
- 🎯 **Player and Ball Tracking**: The system effectively identifies and monitors players and tennis balls in real-time, enabling comprehensive game analysis.
- 📈 **Performance Metrics**: By measuring player speed and shot accuracy, coaches and players can gain valuable insights to enhance training and game strategies.
- 🔍 **YOLO Model Training**: Fine-tuning YOLO significantly improves detection rates, demonstrating the importance of custom training datasets for specific applications.
- 🧠 **Key Point Extraction**: Using PyTorch to extract court key points aids in understanding player positioning and movement relative to the court.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: The mini court representation consolidates performance data visually, making it easier to interpret during analysis.
- ⚙️ **Modular Design**: The project structure promotes reusability and scalability of components, supporting future enhancements and additional features.

## Player Statistics
In addition to tracking players and balls, the system provides player statistics, including:
- **Player Speed**: Analyze the speed of players during matches.
- **Ball Speed**: Measure the speed of the tennis ball for performance evaluation.
- **Play Style Analysis**: Identify player play styles (Aggressive or Defensive) based on movement patterns and shot selection.

## Challenges Faced
Throughout the development of this project, I encountered challenges in:
- Fine-tuning the YOLO model for accurate ball detection.
- Managing object tracking across video frames, especially with fast-moving objects.

## Insights and Applications
The insights gained from this project can enhance training strategies by identifying players’ movement patterns, optimizing positioning, and assessing shot effectiveness. Coaches can utilize data on distance covered and speed to tailor fitness programs, while analysis of ball trajectories can inform tactical adjustments and improve decision-making during matches.
